                        On this site you will learn about both my educational and work experiences, as well as some of the most interesting projects I have worked on. I am currently studying data science at the University Of Toronto.  I have a background in Management Consulting at PwC and an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from Queens University. Combining both my technical expertise and passion for business, I hope to work on solving important problems for businesses through leveraging the power of data.

                        About me, Personally:
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide-description">
                        I grew up in Toronto, completed my undergraduate degree in Kingston Ontario, with a 4-month exchange in Singapore, and most recently spent a year living in Saint John, New Brunswick. For fun, I love to bike in all forms; I have a road bike and I also love to go to spin classes! I am a true pandemic runner as I trained for and completed a half marathon in October of 2020. I love to eat and explore all of Toronto’s amazing restaurants. And my favourite place in the entire world is my family’s cozy cabin up north in Temagami Ontario, where you will find me swimming, eating, and waterskiing all summer long!
