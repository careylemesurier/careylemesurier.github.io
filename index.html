                                                QMIND is an engineering design club at Queen’s University, made up of various teams of 4-5 students. Each team is tasked with researching and solving a project using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
                                                <br> <br>
                                                I worked as a team lead, managing a design team of 4 multidisciplinary undergraduate students. 
                                                My team’s objective was to research different machine learning methods and compare their ability to predict the long term price of a stock based on historical data.

                                                As a leader in the QMIND design team, I also had the opportunity to present at the Canadian Undergraduate Conference on AI (CUCAI). This conference included an open house session for QMIND design teams to showcase their work. During this session, I presented and discussed my team’s research with the conference attendees and industry representatives.

I coordinated an engaging week of activities, teaching the new students about Queen’s Engineering and easing their transition into university.

To solve this the client decided to implement SAP Fieldgalss, a leading Vendor Management system. This project also presented a great opportunity for the bank to got to market in order to consolidate their contingent labour supplier base to realize significant cost savings.

Using a savings-based evaluation framework, I uncovered insights that drove the 3-round negotiation, ultimately leading to $20MM+ in annual savings.

                                                I was responsible for leading the user acceptance testing of the Finance solution across the 17 ministries. I lead and coordinated the testing of 27 scripts over 12 sessions with >450 client participants. To achieve this, I worked closely with a team of 10 functional experts, holding them to deadlines, tracking progress, and providing support when needed. To ensure clear and up to date communication, I developed detailed progress tracking reports, that were ultimately adopted by the Project Management Office for all functional streams.

Working closely with the ERP technical experts I created 8 detailed process maps to standardize processes and improve efficiency. To supplement the process maps I developed corresponding RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) charts, which detailed the stockholders involved in each process and their specific role. Lastly, I analyzed the entire corporation’s historic spending data, and created an interactive dashboard to visually show top suppliers and spend by location, business group, and spend category. This analysis helped inform many key project decisions, including process steps, the supplier enablement strategy, and the technology configuration.

                                                This course provides an in-depth exploration of hardware/software interfacing for microprocessor-based systems, including microcontrollers, with the aim of imparting sufficient knowledge to enable students to design and implement systems of their own, particularly for embedded applications. The philosophy of the course is to progress from low-level internal interconnections and input/output interfaces, through software issues and interrupt processing, to high-level considerations for embedded and system-on-chip applications.

                                                Electric circuit theory and electromagnetic theory are the two fundamental theories upon which all branches of electrical engineering are built, including computer engineering. Many branches of electrical engineering such as power, electric machines, control, electronics, communications, and instrumentation, are based on electric circuit theory. Therefore, the basic electric circuit theory is "the" foundation and starting point for what follows in electrical and computer engineering programs.

I researched and identified a dataset of 600 samples, which was used to train the model. To validate the usability of the data for the project, I designed a machine learning program, using the TensorFlow library in python, which produced a 99% prediction accuracy. I also designed the user interface which captured the data from the phone, fed it through the network, and produced a result in real time.

                                                Through experimenting with various algorithms, the team concluded that the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network produced the most accurate predictions. This algorithm worked well because it considered all historic data, while prioritizing the most recent data samples. The graph displayed here, shows the actual stock market price fluctuations for the Google stock (blue), versus our LSTM model’s predicted future prices (red).

                                                The course project for my fourth year Data Analytics course, required me to analyze a large (7000+ entries) dataset of mock customer data for an Internet Service Provider, to identify reasons customers were leaving.

                                                I cleaned and analyzed this data using KNIME, a data analytics platform. I analyzed the various customer attributes to determine the most significant attributes to consider, using techniques including statistics and correlation. Once I understood the attributes that most significantly correlated to customers leaving, I was able to apply more advanced prediction algorithms to this subset of the attributes. These algorithms included both supervised (decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron) and unsupervised (clustering) learning techniques. For the supervised learning algorithms I was able to achieve ~85% prediction accuracy, which validated the final conclusions I made as to why customers were leaving the company.

I also developed the full UML diagram which kept the entire team aligned on the various classes and methods and how they all interacted.
